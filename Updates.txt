I started out trying to install the visual library, SFML. This went poorly.
So, while I waited for a different solution/ motivation to fix the issue, I decided to start reconstructing the rest of the program.

I started with a very simple system, with everything defined in one file that let two agents play a game of prisoners dilemma.

My next step will be to seperate the game, agents, and main. done

now I need to build the hash function and the history class.
Hash and dehash added, will eventually make the hash flexible, instead of hard coded.

I think I finished history? like all of it?
I also think I finished the game class as well.
